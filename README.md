Propane Refrigeration Loop Simulation in Aspen HYSYS

#Project Description 
This project simulates a propane refrigeration loop using Aspen HYSYS. The simulation models a standard vapor-compression refrigeration cycle using propane as the refrigerant. The system includes an evaporator, compressor, condenser, and expansion valve. The project demonstrates the setup and analysis of the refrigeration cycle, including heat removal, temperature changes, and efficiency considerations.
